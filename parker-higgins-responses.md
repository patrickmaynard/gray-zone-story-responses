Hi Patrick,

I've included my answers in line with questions. Let me know if you need anything else!

-- What kind of precedent would an Assange extradition set?

The danger of an Assange extradition is two-fold: it would lend legitimacy to the Trump DoJ's fundamentally ridiculous and unjust use of the Espionage Act, and it would further normalize the practice of extradition for political aims.

-- China's new national security law regarding Hong Kong tries to extend China's jurisdiction to non-Chinese nationals around the world. Is there some parallel to be found between that assertion of jurisdiction and the United States' assertion of jurisdiction in the Assange case?

Sure, governments around the world have attempted to extend their reach as far as it will go, especially when it comes to essentially borderless issues like censorship.

-- Many journalists have said something along the lines of "I just encourage sources, I don't help them crack passwords." Are future judges likely to parse those differences when examining the precedent that this case sets? Why?

For one thing, the indictment is the government's case, and necessarily paints the events in the light they thing will be most favorable to prosecution. But more fundamentally, there's no guarantee that the line a journalist draws now is going to be the one that future judges follow, and the threat of criminal charges for talking to sources is sure to have a chilling effect.

-- If an extradition takes place, would that be an irreversible precedent? Or are there situations where something like this has been walked back?

In a sense, the more significant precedent is about the underlying charges and not the extradition itself. There are not a lot of direct analogies to what we're seeing right now, but there could be some "escape valves" for prosecutors to drop these charges or change strategy.

-- Do you have to like Julian Assange as a person in order to be against his extradition? Why?

The importance of this case goes far beyond the facts of who Julian Assange is and what he is alleged to have done. There is a principle and a precedent at stake that are important considerations for press freedom, no matter how you feel about Julian Assange himself.

-- Some people have said Assange is a horrible narcissist, and that this is a reason not do defend him. Is he? Does that matter?

(see above)

-- Some people have said Assange is a useful idiot being played by Russia, and that this is a reason not do defend him. Is he? Does that matter?

The allegations in this case predate any Russia involvement by years. But more importantly, it comes back to the same issue about specific facts and general precedent. Even if you're okay with prosecutors throwing the book at Assange because of who he is, nothing prevents those same (or future) prosecutors from going after other publishers.

-- What is the worst-case scenario in this case?

I hesitate to offer a concrete worst-case scenario, because this has gone on so long and under so many permutations that it's come to include cases we never thought were possible. But certainly, extradition and continued prosecution would be a dark outcome for press freedom.

-- Thanks for replying to my questions. Under what name and title should I refer to you in the piece?
