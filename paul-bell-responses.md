Hi there. I'm a freelance journalist writing a story for The Gray Zone about how Transparency International hasn't posted anything about Julian Assange on transparency.org for more than a year. I was wondering if you could provide written responses to a few questions. Here they are:

 

-- First off, am I wrong about the statement that you haven't posted anything? If so, can you provide a link or two to recent postings on the Assange topic?

The Secretariat of Transparency International hasn’t made any statements related to Julian Assange in the last year.

 

-- If I'm not wrong, has your organization been the recipient of pressure from the US or UK government, urging you not to speak out about the Assange extradition?

The Secretariat of Transparency International has not received pressure from any government in relation to this case.

 

-- If I'm not wrong, has your organization been the recipient of pressure from either your international board or directors or the boards of American/UK chapters, urging you not to speak out about the Assange extradition?

TI currently doesn’t have a national chapter in the US (since 2017), but we did open a small sub-office of the International Secretariat in Washington last year. No pressure has been placed on the Secretariat from TI national chapters or the international board related to this issue.

 

-- If I'm not wrong, has the organization received pressure from donors to avoid speaking out about this topic?

It’s our policy to accept funding – whether monetary or in kind – from any donor, provided that acceptance does not impair our independence to pursue our mission or endanger our integrity and reputation. Having said that, we have not received pressure from any donor in relation to this issue.

 

-- If I'm not wrong, is there a different reason that I haven't thought of that explains the organization's silence for more than a year on this topic?

Julian Assange's case raises serious questions regarding the protection of whistleblowers, investigative journalism, freedom of expression and human rights . All issues that we campaign on. While TI has not commented on this specific case, we continue to closely monitor the situation

 

-- Has your organization made statements publicly about the conflicts of interest that Lady Emma Arbuthnot (the judge) had? If so, could you provide a link or two?

The international secretariat hasn’t made any statements in relation to Lady Emma Arbuthnot.

 

-- Has your organization made statements publicly about the UN special rapporteur's finding that Assange may have been tortured? If so, could you provide a link or two?

The international secretariat hasn’t made any statements in relation to the UN special rapporteur’s finding.

 

-- Has your organization made statements publicly about the 36 members of the European Parliament who spoke out on Assange's behalf? If so, could you provide a link or two?

The international secretariat hasn’t made any statements in relation to members of the European Parliament.
